You should refrain from doing\r\nand logic code in `draw`, use it simply for drawing.\r\n```python\r\ndef draw():\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Drawing logic\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n\r\n    # Fill the screen with black\r\n    game.screen.fill((240, 240, 240))\r\n    \r\n    # insert logic here\r\n\r\n    # Don't change these\r\n    pygame.display.update()\r\n    pygame.display.flip()\r\n\r\n    return\r\n```\r\nNotice that there is some code already in the function: you shouldn't change\r\nthese unless you know what you are doing.  Simply insert your own code after\r\nthe comment \"insert logic here\".\r\n\r\n### License\r\n```\r\nCopyright 2014 Joshua Beitler, Brandon Bench, Alveyworld\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License. \r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
